    "description": "The 'Pima Indians Diabetes' dataset aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various diagnostic measurements. It contains records from female patients of Pima Indian heritage, aged 21 or older. The dataset includes 768 instances with 8 numerical features such as number of pregnancies, plasma glucose concentration, blood pressure, skin fold thickness, serum insulin, body mass index (BMI), diabetes pedigree function, and age. The target variable, 'Outcome', is binary (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic).",
