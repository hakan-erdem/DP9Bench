    "description": "The Steel Industry Energy Consumption dataset from DAEWOO Steel Co. in South Korea, records electricity consumption patterns to predict load type (Light Load, Medium Load, Maximum Load). The dataset includes energy usage (kWh), reactive power (kVarh), CO2 emissions (ppm), power factors (%), and time-based factors such as seconds from midnight, weekday/weekend status, and the day of the week. These attributes help analyze power efficiency and demand fluctuations. The data supports predictive modeling for optimizing energy consumption, reducing CO2 emissions, and improving cost efficiency in steel manufacturing.",
