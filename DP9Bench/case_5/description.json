    "description": "The Abalone dataset is used to predict the age of abalone based on physical measurements. Since determining age traditionally requires cutting the shell and counting rings under a microscope, this dataset provides an alternative approach using easily obtainable features. It consists of both categorical and continuous attributes, including sex (M, F, I for infant), length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, and shell weight. The target variable, 'Rings,' represents the number of growth rings, and adding 1.5 approximates the abaloneâ€™s age in years. This dataset is widely used for regression tasks in machine learning.",
