    "description": "The Bike Sharing dataset contains hourly and daily rental bike counts for the Capital Bikeshare system from 2011 to 2012, along with corresponding weather and seasonal information. Bike sharing systems automate the entire rental process, making them an efficient and popular mode of transport. This dataset is valuable for studying urban mobility, as it records explicit travel details, turning the system into a virtual sensor network for city monitoring. The dataset includes time-related attributes such as date, season, month, hour, and weekday. Weather conditions are represented by categorical and normalized numerical values for temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The target variable, 'cnt,' represents the total number of rented bikes, which is the sum of casual and registered users. This dataset is widely used for regression and time-series forecasting tasks. It is important to remember that the time-series datasets need to be sorted in chronological order before model training.",
