    "description":"The 'Census Income' dataset contains records from the 1994 Census, aimed at predicting whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50K based on various demographic and employment attributes. The dataset includes 15 features such as age, workclass, education, capital gain, and native country, as well as the target variable, which indicates whether the person's income is greater than $50K (labeled as '>50K') or less than or equal to $50K (labeled as '<=50K'). The dataset includes both continuous features (e.g., age, education-num, capital gain, hours-per-week) and categorical features (e.g., workclass, education, native country). The dataset provides a mixture of both personal and employment-related factors, making it suitable for classification tasks to predict high-income individuals.",
