    "description": "The 'Mushroom' dataset contains 8,124 samples of hypothetical mushrooms from the Agaricus and Lepiota families. Each sample includes 23 attributes related to physical characteristics such as cap shape, cap color, gill spacing, stalk color, odor, and habitat. The dataset classifies mushrooms into three categories: edible, poisonous, and of unknown edibility (which was combined with the poisonous category). The goal is to use these physical characteristics to classify mushrooms based on their edibility.",
