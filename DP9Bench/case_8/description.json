    "description": "The Concrete Compressive Strength dataset consists of 1,030 instances and 9 attributes, with 8 quantitative input variables and 1 quantitative output variable. It is used to predict the compressive strength of concrete, a crucial material in civil engineering. The dataset includes measurements of cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse and fine aggregates, and the concrete's age (ranging from 1 to 365 days). The target variable is the concrete's compressive strength in MPa. This dataset is valuable for regression modeling to analyze how different material compositions and aging periods affect concrete strength.",
