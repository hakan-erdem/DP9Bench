    "description": "This dataset, sourced from Cortez et al., 2009, contains physicochemical properties of wine samples alongside sensory-based quality ratings. It includes 11 input variables representing chemical characteristics such as acidity, sugar content, sulfur dioxide levels, pH, and alcohol percentage. The target variable is wine quality, scored between 0 and 10 based on sensory evaluations. The dataset can be used for regression or classification tasks to model the relationship between chemical composition and perceived wine quality.",
